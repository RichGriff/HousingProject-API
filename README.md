# HousingProject-API

### Overview
The purpose of this API is to simulate how an Housing Association may want thier tenants to connect and gain access to their account information and services. 

### Information Available
- User information
- Tenant details
- Properties
- Accounts

These details should be enough to start with to be able to build some logic in frontend applications and can always be expanded on!

### Planned Front-End Applications
- ⚛️ Customer Portal *Coming Soon* 
- 📱 Customer App (android) *Coming Soon*
- 💻 Admin Portal (Possibly part of the customer portal) *Coming Soon*
